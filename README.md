# Gasoline-data-analysis
A local gas station in Toronto sells 3 grades of gasoline 365 days a year and employs 12 staff including a Station Manager &amp; Assistant Manager. Is it viable?
Is there any correlation between 3 grades of gasoline in sales dollars? Are the grades substitutes or complimentary?
